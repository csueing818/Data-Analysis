            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <Tennis> The project aimed to track win and loss ratio, ranking progression, and surface performance over three years. The packed circle chart was chosen to compare the types of surfaces used for 2022,2023,2024. The data was obtained from WTA tennis rankings, results, and statistical data from a github repo. Based on the data for the individuals that are not winning I would ensure that he or she is actively participating in tournaments each year. However, if he or she plays each year, I would analyze the round and the number of sets associated with each round.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p> The purpose of the project was to compare book ratings, language code, and number of people who have read the books by the author. The bar graph chart was used to compare the authors book ratings on goodreads. A tree map chart was used to identify the number of people who read a particular book by the author. Highlighted tables were used to identify the language codes.The statistical data was obtained from a goodbooks github repo. Insights that I found from the data was authors whom are less known has a lower book count read by the audience. A suggestion that I would make would be to curate the members list by topic and not to include ratings to allow the reader to form their opinion about the particular book.

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p> Student engagement with the course was tracked using: scores,course codes, registration and credits. Horizontal bar graphs were used to compare course codes and the number of courses for each code. Student scores were compared using a horizontal bar graph that identified the students id with their test score. Student credits were compared using a horizontal bar graph which included the level of education per region. Student registration also used a bar graph to identity the number of student who were registered or chose to unregister. Student engagement was tracked using number of clicks per students. Insights that I gained from the data were, students that were less engaged with the course did not achieve scores over 100, on a rating scale of 0-1200. A suggestion that I would recommend would be to provide the student with a detailed study plan for the month.
